## What is git? (and what is GitHub?)

All this has something to do with saving our work, specifically code related things we produce. Let's start by looking at the most "normal" way of saving files. Every time we save, we overwrite the old version of the file we are working on,  a bit like this:

Git, and let's don't even think of GitHub yet, is a framework that we can use on our computer for a different kind of saving behaviour: version control. It means that aside from saving our file and overwriting what it was saved as before, we also save all the versions before, too. In other words, all the changes done to the file are being tracked over time. This also allows to go back to older versions of a file or to branch of in different directions to try out thing (e.g. "hey, I think I should restructure my code and use arrays instead of the thousands of variables I am using!"). Version control is a bit like this (just that in the drawing it looks like a new copy is added on every save, which would take a lot of memory space. In reality, only the actual changes to the file are saved):

Let's imagine our working environment as our Desktop - the files of a project we are currently working on - and a git repository (repo for short) - that is the place where the changes on the project's files are being tracked. The git repo, at any given point, is either up-to-date with our changes on the files, or behind. To bring them to the latest version, we **commit** our changes. On our computer we can have multiple different such repos for different project. I am thinking of a shelves in my computer, one for each project. When we work on a project and commit changes, we are adding new files to the corresponding shelf ;-)

So, git is a framework that we use locally, on our computer, to keep track of changes on our files on a per project basis - one project, one repo. Let's get to GitHub. GitHub is a website, a space online/remote from our own computers where we can back up our repos. When you make a GitHub account, you are given a space on their database when you can keep copies of those git shelves that are on your computer. Just like the git repo in relation to our working files, the GitHub version of the project, at any given time, is either up-to-date with the latest version of our local repo, or behind. To update it (after commiting changes to the local repo), we **push** the local repo to GitHub.

GitHub is great for many reasons. It's amazing to share code and also amazing to be able to use code that other people share, too. You can also work off other people's code and make your own project out of it. Beyond that, GitHub is the place through which collaborating on code project becomes possible, as different people making changes to a project can push to the same project on GitHub. GitHub is a huge place where every user has their own little library of repos and can wander around to look at other people's work.

## Make a GitHub account

That part is easy, you can follow the steps [here](https://github.com/join?source=header-home). If you are a student I recommend getting the [Student Developer Pack](https://education.github.com/pack) which gives you some benefits.

## Work on your own project

What's a project? At the very least I would say a project is a folder. Whatever is in that folder and makes up the project is relative. Since that is the case, we can turn any folder on our computer into git repos, that means we can declare "I want to track changes on files in this folder from now on.".

The things we want to do are 1) declare a folder to be a git repo 2) repeatedly commit the changes we make to files to the that local repo and back up the repo to a project on our github account.

To declare a folder to be a git repo, open your command line and navigate to the folder. Then use the follwing command:
```
git init
```

... as you can see it says that a git repo has been created and seems to prove that fact by pointing to the `.git` file in that folder. Files starting with a dot are not normally visible in the Finder, you can see them when you type `ls -a` on your command line. The `git init` command added this file to the folder in which from now on changes are being tracked whenever we commit them. 

Now, after adding some lines of code to our project files and/or deleting some others, we can commit the changes to our local git repo. To do that however, we first need to make clear the changes of which files we want to commit. We do that using the `git add` command in one of the following ways
```
git add [file or folder name]
```
this will let us commit changes, but only the ones made in a specific file or files in a folder. To commit simply all changes made to any file in this project use
```
git add -A
```
Personally that is what I use most of the times, in combination with a .gitignore mechanism (explained below) that allows to list files and folders that should simply be never tracked at all.

After having selected which files to commit changes of, we can commit the changes. This always happens with a little commit message in which we explain briefly what changes were done, e.g.
```
git commit -m "ðŸš€ added a great new function!"
```
